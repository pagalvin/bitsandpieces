Bits and pieces of useful code

The best way to figure out what is really here is to browse through the folder structure.

This is a visual studio 2015 project so if you want to use that, you'll get VS2015 tooling. 

You'll need to make sure that whatever project you use for this has the various dependencies. I will probably create a bower.json file at some point so that it's easy to get them integrate in, but for now, you'll want at least:
- moment
- angular 1.5+
- SharePoint typings
- Typings for moment, etc.
